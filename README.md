Liberty University's Gloo Hackathon Team Repository

A minimal three-service web app, all in Docker:

```
frontend  React (Vite) served by nginx, proxies /api -> backend
backend   FastAPI
db        Postgres
```

## Run it

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>. The API is at <http://localhost:8000/api/health>,
with interactive docs at <http://localhost:8000/docs>.

Defaults work out of the box — copy `.env.example` to `.env` only if you want to
change the database credentials.

## What each piece does

| Path | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/App.jsx` | The whole UI: a task list talking to `/api`. |
| `frontend/nginx.conf` | Serves the built bundle, sends `/api` to the backend. |
| `backend/app/main.py` | The HTTP routes — list, add, toggle, delete. |
| `backend/app/db.py` | Connection pool and the SQL queries. |
| `db/init.sql` | Schema, applied the first time the Postgres volume is created. |

## Notes

- Postgres and the backend publish ports (5432, 8000) so you can poke at them
  directly. Only port 3000 is needed to use the app — drop the others from
  `docker-compose.yml` if you'd rather not expose them.
- The Postgres data lives in the `db_data` volume. `docker compose down -v`
  wipes it and re-runs `db/init.sql` on the next start.
- Changing `db/init.sql` after the first start does nothing until you drop that
  volume — it only runs on an empty data directory.
